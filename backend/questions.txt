❓ Why do we separate app.js and server.js?
🧠 Simple Explanation

We separate them to keep responsibilities clean.

📁 app.js — Application Logic
This file:
Creates the Express app
Adds middlewares (JSON, CORS, routes)
Does NOT start the server
👉 Think of it as the app configuration

🚀 server.js — Server & Infrastructure
This file:
Connects to the database
Starts listening on a port
Handles environment setup
👉 Think of it as the app launcher

🔥 Why This Is Important (Real Reasons)
1️⃣ Clean code structure
2️⃣ Easier testing (you can test app without starting server)
3️⃣ Scales well for large apps
4️⃣ Used in real production projects

🧠 One-line rule (memorize this):

app.js builds the app, server.js runs the app.
